##### There are two common types of recommender systems:
- __Collaborative filtering__: produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users' attitude to items. It uses the "wisdom of the crowd" to recommend items.

- __Content based recommender system__: these focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.

In general Collaborative filtering (CF) is more commonly used. As it gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from an overall implementation perspective).

The practice and lesson notebook cover a Content based recommender system.
