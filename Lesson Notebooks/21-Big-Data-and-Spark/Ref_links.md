# Updated References
The first two references provided by the course is up to date (as they are maintained by AWS themselves). So the steps for seeting up EC2 and connecting via SSG is still up to date.

However, the last reference for setting up Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Spark & other resources is outdated. I added updated links for installing these on latest versions of Ubuntu (18.04 as of this lesson).
